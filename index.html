  		<div class="left">
  			<h2>Leftie Kitty</h2>
  			<p>This div should float on the left. It has a title and some paragraph text. I'm writing some more text here to make the paragraph longer. Tilly is my cat's name. She is a four-year-old ragdoll cat. She is nice to me but mean to everyone else in the world. She once trapped my sister in the bathroom for 2 hours while I was on vacation. My dog Jack is also afraid of her. Ok, I think this paragraph is long enough now.

  		<div class="right">
  			<img src="http://placekitten.com/g/400/400">
  			<p>This div should float on the right. Helpful hint, the image width should be set to 100% width of its container div for optimal floating.</p>
